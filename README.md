OpenVPN Active Directory Authentication

----------

Running an OpenVPN server on Windows? You can use this to authenticate OpenVPN connections against Active Directory.

The original VBS script that I used has apparently not been updated since 2009. It remains at "version 1.0". 

I am hosting it here, as well as posting some updates to it. 

I wanted to be able to share my changes and make them public, as well.
